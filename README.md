   - A super interesting pathfinding application that allows you to visualize the power of the Breadth First Search Algorithm. Try it out and watch the app find the quickest path from the starting point to your destination every time!
  # Usage
 Start using the app by hovering over the canvas with your mouse to take control of the path line. You can take the path anywhere on the canvas and it will continously find the quickest path from the start point to wherever you take it. You can click at any moment to make the current position your new starting point.
